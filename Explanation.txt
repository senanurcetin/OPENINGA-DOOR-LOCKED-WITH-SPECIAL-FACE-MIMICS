This project, which was made to help this need, assigns the combination formed with the determined gestures as a password. 
Then, face recognition and face recognition methodologies are used to enable people who know this password to unlock the door with the right combination.
People who know the password can open the door, and the video record of the people who log in is stored. 
Also, the interface structure we use in our project provides convenience to users.
In addition, it offers ease of use to administrators who are authorized to change password and access records.
